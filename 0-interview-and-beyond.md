#Interview and Beyond

##Behavorial
- Behavioral questions may come up
- When answering questions, be specific not arrogant
- Say exactly what you did, and the level of difficulty
- Be concise about description
- Elaborate if necessary
- Prepare questions for the interviewer
	- interesting technologies
	- what kind of work new hires do

- Structure behavorial answers with **S.A.R**
	- Situation
	- Action
	- Result

##Technical

When it comes to solving technical interview questions, there are five steps for solving problems

1. Ask questions
2. Design Algorithm
3. Pseudo-code
4. Code
5. Test

###Step 1 - Ask Questions

- what kind of data types
- what kind of data
- how much data is there
- who is the user
- what assumptions to make

###Step 2 - Design an Algorithm

Five approaches for designing an algorithm

1. Examplify - Write out specific examples of the problem
2. Pattern matching - Consider what problems the algorithm is similar to. See if you can modify those solutions to fit this problem
3. Simplify & Generalize - Change a constraint fo the problem. After solving simpler problem try adding the constraint back
4. Base case and Build - Solve algorithm for base case, then solve for more increasingly complex examples. Normally useful for recursive problems
5. Data structure Brainstorm - Hacky. Run through a list of data structures, try applying each one

###Step 3 - Pseudo-Code

Make sure to tell interviewer you're writing pseudocode at this stage

###Step 4 - Code

- Don't rush this step
- Leave space on white board (start from top left)
- Use data structures generously (make a Person class)

###Step 5 - Test

- Write test cases to test your code
	- Extreme Cases: 0, negative, null, maxes
	- User error: what happens if user passes 'bad' value
	- General cases

##Top Ten Mistakes

1. Practicing on a Computer
2. Not rehearsing behavioral questions
3. Not doing a mock interview
4. Trying to memorize solutions
5. Talking too much
6. Talking too little
7. Rushing
8. Not debugging
9. Sloppy Coding
10. Giving up
