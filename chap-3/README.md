#Stacks and Queues

[Source](http://www.sourcetricks.com/2008/07/c-stacks.html#.WBKb_2V2AX8)

Stacks are a first in last out (FILO) data structure. **Note:** last in first out (LIFO) is the same thing.

Typical use cases of a stack:

- Function call stacks from debuggers
- call and return process
- memory managment
- backtracking

- It's restricted data structure since it only has a few methods
	- push - add element to top stack
	- pop - remove element from top of stack
	- top/peek - view the element at the top of the stack
