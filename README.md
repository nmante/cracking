#Cracking the Coding Interview (4th edition) solutions

These are my solutions/work to the problems in Cracking the Coding Interview.

Feel free to fork, clone or even just browse this code. It contains C++ and Python solutions to the problems. I did some solutions in C++, and some in Python.

The c++ solutions can be compiled by running `make` in each of the chap-x folders. You can even run the executables. For example, to run the solution for problem 1-3, navigate to the chapter 1 directory, run `make` and simply type `./1-3.out`

	cd chap-1
	make
	./1-3.out
